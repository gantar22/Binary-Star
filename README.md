Binary Star is a cooperative couch party game that brings new meaning to the "twin stick shooter" genre.
Work with your partner to control a space ship together and fight off waves of alien enemies: One player pilots the ship while the other controls the cannons.
You will have to upgrade your ship and unlock powerful new abilities in order to take on increasingly challenging waves.
It will take a combination of teamwork and skill to reach the final boss.
Do you have what it takes to defeat him and unlock endless mode?
